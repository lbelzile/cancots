    "text": "The first Canadian Conference on Teaching Statistics (CanCOTS 2025) will be hosted by HEC Montréal from Wednesday June 11th to Thursday June 12th, 2025. CanCOTS will be a participant-driven working meeting in the style of a curated “unconference”. After an initial roundtable aimed at engaging participants with state-of-the-art literature, the participants will split in small groups, each working on a priority area of interest. These priority areas will be short-listed before the meeting, so participants can arrive already having an idea of what they may want to collaboratively contribute to with their time, and can bring potential resources to share with the group.\nEach small group will define and, at the end of the meeting, leave with concrete deliverables, either in progress or completed. Depending on the priority area, these deliverables could be in the form of conference proceeding papers or less traditional formats (e.g., banks of exercises, guidelines for curriculum, sample learning activities and assessment items, etc.)\n\n\nFormat\nEach small working group will be led by a team leader who will facilitate discussion and encourage progress toward the agreed upon deliverable(s). This team leader will also be responsible for giving a short introduction to the priority area to help launch the first day, and to motivate the working sessions that follow. Each group will present to all participants at the beginning of the second day to give a quick recap of the progress they made, and a final presentation at the end of the conference. The team leaders will be selected from volunteers from the community of statistics educators attending the conference, and will oversee the deliverables. CanCOTS will also be used to discuss the current state and needs of the statistical education community in Canada.\n\n\nFinancial support\nWe are reserving $3K of the budget for travel support thanks to funding from CANSSI, which will be awarded based on need. The priority will be for graduate students and early career researchers (less than five years from latest degree) without support from Tri-Council funding or equivalent grants. Priority will be given in order received until funds are exhausted.\nFunding will be allocated by the scientific committee after the conference and adjudicated based on need. Participants must send their CV and a cover letter to the scientific committee to ask for support, explaining how they’d use the travel funds, whether not receiving funding would limit their ability to attend, and whether they have other sources of (partial) funding; the scientific committee will adjudicate the funding based on participants needs.\n\n\nPriority areas\nParticipants must choose a working group upon registration (it will be possible to modify the latter by changing your answer in the form). Each working group will define and, at the end of the meeting, leave with concrete deliverables, either in progress or completed. The group leaders will contact participants at the beginning of June to exchange material and decide on outcomes.\nThe list of working groups and team leaders is\n\nDesigning a modern master program in statistics or data science (Wesley Burr, Lisa Lix)\nInteractive R tutorials for learning and assessments (Russell Steele, David Riegert and Léo Belzile)\nUniversal design and Evidence-based teaching for learning in statistics education (Nathalie Moon, Asal Asleman)\nTeaching advanced analytical topics in biostatistics courses (Kuan Liu)\nIncorporating artificial intelligence and ethics in statistics curriculum (Anne-Sophie Charest)\nIncorporating causal inference in statistics courses (G. Alexi Rodríguez-Arelis)\n\n\nDesigning a modern master program in statistics or data science\nDeliverables:\n\nDefine potential learning objectives for a new Master’s program\nEnumerate current challenges and opportunities at Canadian universities in constructing new Master’s programs in Statistics/Biostatistics,\nDescribe the role of AI in developing the curriculum and facilitating change in existing curriculum\nDiscuss experiential learning opportunities.\n\n\n\nInteractive R tutorials for learning and assessments\nThanks to software development, it is possible to use R for randomization of assignments and assessments, including in WebWork and via rexams. There are also numerous R packages (learnr, webR) that allow for interactive coding with automated feedback, a feature which is useful in large classrooms. This working group will explore research questions revolving around use of these tools in the classroom for asynchronous, online of flipped classrooms.\nObjectives\n\nDetermine under which circumstances interactive tutorials are most useful\nProvide guidelines and strategies for efficient design of questions and exercises to assess learning\nExplore different methods and integration with learning management systems\nDetermine how use of large language models (LLM) can help with question generation, and how to make questions LLM-proofed in the context of assessment.\n\nDeliverables:\n\nPeer-reviewed publication or a white paper reviewing the objectives\nOnline tutorial (book format) with examples of questions and details about implementation\nDatabase with sample questions and examples for different platforms\n\n\n\nUniversal design for learning in statistics education\nObjectives:\n\nExplore methods to make statistical learning more inclusive for students with diverse learning needs, backgrounds, interests, and goals\nShare techniques for creating adaptable learning materials and assessment strategies which are aligned with course learning objectives and consider generative AI\n\nDeliverables:\n\nCreating a library of course-level learning objectives for various statistics courses (depending on participants’ interests and experience), along with a banks of proposed assessment types/formats and learning activities to align with these objectives.\n\n\n\nTeaching advanced analytical topics in biostatistics courses\nThere is an increasing need to design biostatistics courses covering advanced and newer modelling techniques that better support graduate students in health sciences. I have observed two distinct features of this student cohort\n\nstudents are eager to learn and implement new modelling techniques they see in their field of literature (e.g., causal random forest, target trial etc), and\nthey often lack the foundational knowledge and programming skills needed to fully understand these approaches.\n\nMany of these students went on to work as clinician scientists, and methodologists at public health agencies and pharma. Traditional teaching models/curriculums for teaching undergraduate health or life sciences students do not effectively translate to this audience, motivating new approaches that align with their unique needs.\nObjectives: This working group can help discuss best practices for teaching advanced biostatistics to graduate health sciences students, modify curriculum design that balances theory with application, and create assessments that foster strategies to enhance interdisciplinary collaboration between health scientists and biostatisticians.\nDeliverables: The proposed deliverables can potentially include a set of recommendations for course design, strategies for integrating statistical training into health sciences curricula, and a framework for strengthening interdisciplinary connections to bridge knowledge and research silos.\n\n\nIncorporating artificial intelligence and ethics in statistics curriculum\nObjectives: defining clear learning outcomes for the students. In my experience, establishing well-defined learning objectives ensures that instructional activities are purposeful and that assessments align with intended goals.\nFor generative AI, for instance, the key question should not be whether to allow its use in courses but rather how it should reshape the learning outcomes we prioritize. Are there traditional skills that should be de-emphasized? What new competencies should be developed? Should we just allow students to work with generative AI, as we do with text editors and such, or should we actually teach how to use them, and evaluate their outputs, more like we do with statistical software. I propose starting by drafting specific learning objectives, followed by discussions on how to teach and assess them effectively, including concrete evaluation methods and grading rubrics.\n\n\nEvidence-based learning\nObjectives:\n\nDiscuss evidence-based approaches to assessment and how they can be aligned with course learning objectives to improve both feedback and learning outcomes.\nExplore pedagogical designs that support student-centered learning, focusing on strategies that promote active engagement, critical thinking, and deeper conceptual understanding in statistics.\nExamine research on simulation-based inference and how this innovative approach, especially through visualization, supports students’ intuitive grasp of statistical inference and complex concepts.\nEngage participants in constructing concept and/or mind maps to visualize connections between evidence-based teaching strategies and core components of statistics education, such as assessment design, conceptual understanding, and student-centered learning.\n\nDeliverables:\n\nSummarize published interventions, focusing on their goals, methods, and outcomes.\nReflect on the feasibility and transferability of these strategies across diverse institutional contexts.\nShare group-generated concept and mind maps that integrate assessment, pedagogy, and instructional tools.\nSynthesize key insights into a working white paper that outlines future directions for pedagogy, research, and faculty development.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncorporating causal inference in statistics courses\nCausal inference is not often covered in core statistics courses despite it’s prevalence in biostatistics and clinical trials. Most introductory books are too technical for users. Some core concepts are covered as part of experimental designs courses, but these often don’t touch upon modern topics such as A/B testing for online experiments or quasi-experiments. Coverage of methods for observational data is often treated separately altogether, if at all.\nDeliverables: the proposed deliverables for a working group of this class is an overall course curriculum on causal inference (including lesson plan, learning objectives, and an overall structure of course content) with two fundamental pillars: experimentation and quasi-experimentation. A stretch goal of this working group would be incorporating data science-flavored topics such as A/B testing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVenue\nThe conference will take place on the 5th floor of the Hélène Desmarais building.\n\n501, rue de la Gauchetière Ouest Montréal, QC H2Z 1Z5\n\nThe main room will be Salle de cours MNP (A.536) (pdf map) and adjacent study rooms (A.545 Denis-Girouard, A.547 Laurent_Ferreira, A.563 Chongqing, A.565 Colombo, A.579 Hô Chi Minh-Ville). \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe downtown campus is easily reached by public transport, either via metro (Square-Victoria-OACI station, orange line), or from the Gare Centrale REM station.\nSome employees of STM, the Montreal Public Transport system, will be on strike during CanCOTS.
