# Background

"Conferences On Teaching Statistics" have a long and rich history, starting from the earliest such international conferences (International Conference on Teaching Statistics – ICOTS) in 1982 (Sheffield, UK) and 1986 (Victoria, Canada). A total of eleven ICOTS have been held, every 4 years since 1982, and a number of regional versions, including 

- [OZCOTS](https://www.isi-web.org/event-detail/89) (Australia and NZ), 
- [USCOTS](https://www.causeweb.org/cause/uscots/uscots25) (United States), 
- [eCOTS](https://www.causeweb.org/cause/ecots/ecots24), 
- [UKCOTS](https://www.ukcots.org/) (United Kingdom), 
- [CFIES](https://cfies2024.sciencesconf.org/?lang=fr) (France, Belgium)

have also been held. 


# Format 

CanCOTS-DS will be a participant-driven working meeting in the style of a curated “unconference”. After an initial roundtable aimed at engaging participants with state-of-the-art literature, the participants will split in small groups, each working on a priority area of interest. These priority areas will be short-listed before the meeting, so participants can arrive already having an idea of what they may want to collaboratively contribute to with their time, and can bring potential resources to share with the group. 


Each small group will define and, at the end of the meeting, leave with concrete deliverables, either in progress or completed. Depending on the priority area, these deliverables could be in the form of conference proceeding papers or less traditional formats (e.g., banks of exercises, guidelines for curriculum, sample learning activities and assessment items, etc.)

Each small working group will be led by a team leader who will facilitate discussion and encourage progress toward the agreed upon deliverable(s). This team leader will also be responsible for giving a short introduction to the priority area to help launch the first day, and to motivate the working sessions that follow. These team leaders will be selected from volunteers from the community of statistics educators attending the conference, and will oversee the deliverables.


# Priority areas

The organizers will solicit proposals for priority areas for the small-group working sessions from the community and carry out a vote to gauge interest in the proposals. In advance of the meeting, selected priority areas will be defined, team leaders will be identified, and the chosen areas will be shared with participants to elicit ideas in preparation.  As a launching pad for this community-driven shortlisting, some initial ideas will be shared.  These potential priority areas include:


- Designing a modern Master’s Degree in Statistics - learning outcomes, curriculum, courses, textbooks and more
- Developing WeBWorK adaptive problems for a course in linear models
- Teaching Portfolio Design and Review - the Hows, the Whys, and the Whats
- Design of Learning Outcomes for Selected Statistics Topics - A Bank for Syllabi Creation
- Adaptive Tutorials for Learning R using `learnR`
- Rethinking Statistics Curricula that Leverages Generative AI
- Decolonizing Statistics Courses and Curricula
- Incorporating evidence-based practices; approaches to consider can include, for example, active learning methods, spaced repetition, repeated testing, interleaving, and cumulative practice
- Incorporation of causal inference in undergraduate courses: learning outcome, sample learning activities and sample assessment items.
- Second statistics course for life science students: develop learning outcomes, sample learning activities, and sample assessment items
