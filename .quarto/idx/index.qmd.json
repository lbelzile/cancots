After an initial roundtable aimed at engaging participants with state-of-the-art literature, the participants will split in small groups, each working on a priority area of interest. These priority areas will be short-listed before the meeting, so participants can arrive already having an idea of what they may want to collaboratively contribute to with their time, and can bring potential resources to share with the group. \n\n\nEach small group will define and, at the end of the meeting, leave with concrete deliverables, either in progress or completed. Depending on the priority area, these deliverables could be in the form of conference proceeding papers or less traditional formats (e.g., banks of exercises, guidelines for curriculum, sample learning activities and assessment items, etc.)\n\nEach small working group will be led by a team leader who will facilitate discussion and encourage progress toward the agreed upon deliverable(s). This team leader will also be responsible for giving a short introduction to the priority area to help launch the first day, and to motivate the working sessions that follow. These team leaders will be selected from volunteers from the community of statistics educators attending the conference, and will oversee the deliverables.\n\n\n# Priority areas\n\nThe organizers will solicit proposals for priority areas for the small-group working sessions from the community and carry out a vote to gauge interest in the proposals. In advance of the meeting, selected priority areas will be defined, team leaders will be identified, and the chosen areas will be shared with participants to elicit ideas in preparation.  As a launching pad for this community-driven shortlisting, some initial ideas will be shared.  These potential priority areas include:\n\n\n- Designing a modern Master’s Degree in Statistics - learning outcomes, curriculum, courses, textbooks and more\n- Developing WeBWorK adaptive problems for a course in linear models\n- Teaching Portfolio Design and Review - the Hows, the Whys, and the Whats\n- Design of Learning Outcomes for Selected Statistics Topics - A Bank for Syllabi Creation\n- Adaptive Tutorials for Learning R using `learnR`\n- Rethinking Statistics Curricula that Leverages Generative AI\n- Decolonizing Statistics Courses and Curricula\n- Incorporating evidence-based practices; approaches to consider can include, for example, active learning methods, spaced repetition, repeated testing, interleaving, and cumulative practice\n- Incorporation of causal inference in undergraduate courses: learning outcome, sample learning activities and sample assessment items.\n- Second statistics course for life science students: develop learning outcomes, sample learning activities, and sample assessment items\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\nThe first Canadian Conference on Teaching Statistics (CanCOTS 2025) will be hosted by HEC Montréal from Wednesday June 11th to Thursday June 12th, 2025. \n\nA satellite workshop for college instructors on simulation-based inference will take place on Tuesday, June 10th.\n\n# Venue\n\n\nThe conference will take place on the 5th floor of the [Hélène Desmarais building](https://www.hec.ca/en/campus/helene-desmarais/index.html).\n \n> 501, rue De La Gauchetière Ouest\n  Montréal, QC H2Z 1Z5\n\n<!--\n<iframe src=\"https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d2796.365751401334!2d-73.56449911877985!3d45.502715437357786!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x4cc91b02024eb64b%3A0xc77fcbb1944fc2f8!2zSEVDIE1vbnRyw6lhbCAtIMOJZGlmaWNlIEjDqWzDqG5lLURlc21hcmFpcw!5e0!3m2!1sfr!2sca!4v1733540271309!5m2!1sfr!2sca\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" style=\"border:0;\" allowfullscreen=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" referrerpolicy=\"no-referrer-when-downgrade\"></iframe>\n-->\n\n```{r}\n#| eval: true\n#| echo: false\n#| out-width: '90%'\nlibrary(leaflet)\nleaflet() |>\n  addTiles() |>  # Add default OpenStreetMap map tiles\n  addMarkers(lng=-73.5644991, \n             lat=45.5027154, \n             popup=\"HEC Montréal - Hélène-Desmarais building\")\n```\n\n\n\nThe downtown campus is easily reached by public transport, either via [metro](https://www.stm.info/en/info/networks/metro) ([Square-Victoria-OACI station](https://www.stm.info/fr/infos/reseaux/metro/square-victoria-oaci), orange line), or from the [Gare Centrale REM station](https://rem.info/en/travelling/stations/gare-centrale).\n\nThe main room will be [Salle de cours MNP (A.536)](https://www.hec.ca/en/campus/helene-desmarais/niveau-5-en-us/index.html) ([pdf map](https://www.hec.ca/en/campus/helene-desmarais/niveau-5-en-us/hec-plan-ehd-niveau-5.pdf)) and adjacent study rooms (Denis-Girouard A.545 and Laurent-Ferreira A.547).\n\n# Scientific committee\n\n- [Léo Belzile](https://lbelzile.bitbucket.io) (HEC Montréal, contactperson)\n- [Alison Gibbs](https://alisongibbs.github.io/) (University of Toronto)\n- [Wesley Burr](http://www.wesleyburr.com/pages/about.html) (Trent University)\n- [Bruce Dunham](https://www.stat.ubc.ca/bruce-dunham) (UBC)\n\n# Sponsors\n\nWe gratefully acknowledge financial support from \n\n- the [Canadian Statistical Science Institute (CANSSI)](https://canssi.ca/) with support from [NSERC](https://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/index_eng.asp), \n- the [Statistical Education section](https://ssc.ca/en/about/sections-regions/statistical-education) of the [Statistical Society of Canada](https://ssc.ca/en)\n- the [*Centre de Recherche Mathématiques*](https://www.crmath.ca/)\n- [HEC Montréal](https://www.hec.ca)\n\n```{r}\n#| eval: true\n#| echo: false\n#| layout-ncol: 3\n#| out-width: '90%'\n#| fig-align: 'center'\nknitr::include_graphics(path = \"files/CANSSI_logo.png\")\nknitr::include_graphics(path = \"files/HEC_logo.png\")\nknitr::include_graphics(path = \"files/SSC_logo.png\")\nknitr::include_graphics(path = \"files/CRM_logo.png\")\n```\n\n# Background\n\n\"Conferences On Teaching Statistics\" have a long and rich history, starting from the earliest such international conferences (International Conference on Teaching Statistics – ICOTS) in 1982 (Sheffield, UK) and 1986 (Victoria, Canada).
